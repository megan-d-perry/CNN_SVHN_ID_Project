# CNN_SVHN_ID_Project
A project on image classification comparing Convolution Neural Networks, using Tensorflow

The main objective of the project was to develop a system that could accurately recognize and extract house numbers from images. To achieve this, we compared the latest techniques in computer vision and deep learning to create a robust and scalable solution. The system was trained on a large dataset of images, containing a diverse range of house numbers in different conditions and environments.
